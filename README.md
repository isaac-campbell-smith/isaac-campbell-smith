<p>
I'm a data and machine learning engineer, photographer, filmmaker and comedian. I'm passionate about data, creative business problem-solving, and actionable story telling. Some technologies I enjoy working with include Python, dbt and the Snowflake. I've worked on comedy special recommenders, ETL fraud detection applications and lots of SQL data modelling. </p>

### ðŸ’» Currently Working On:

* I am currently open to work! At the moment I'm generally targeting analytics engineering roles but would love to take on more data platform work.

### ðŸ“š Currently Learning More About:

* BI theory and principles. I purchased the book [Business unIntelligence](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18230651-business-unintelligence) and have been enjoying being exposed to new ideas on what goes into effective business decision making. 

* Bayesian Statistics, primarily through the book [Statistical Rethinking](https://www.routledge.com/Statistical-Rethinking-A-Bayesian-Course-with-Examples-in-R-and-STAN/McElreath/p/book/9780367139919).
