### Hi, I'm Isaac ðŸ‘‹

I'm a data scientist, photographer, filmmaker and comedian who is passionate about creative business solutions, open data and telling fresh stories from new perspectives. Some technologies I enjoy working with include Python, Tableau and the Adobe Creative Suite. I've worked on comedy special recommenders, ETL fraud detection applications and currently using Seattle traffic collisions data to identify road features that lead to increased collision rates.
