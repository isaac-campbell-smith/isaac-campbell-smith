<p>
I'm a data analyst/engineer/scientist, photographer, filmmaker and comedian who is passionate about creative business solutions, open data and telling fresh stories from new perspectives. Some technologies I enjoy working with include Python, Tableau and the Adobe Creative Suite. I've worked on comedy special recommenders, ETL fraud detection applications and SQL database engineering. </p>

* ETL competitive Pokemon battling data analysis using a SQL database I built using raw data from [Pokemon Showdown](https://play.pokemonshowdown.com/). 

* Listener Data Analysis for Leafly's flagship news podcast, 'The Roll-Up'.

* SQL Database Engineering for the independent movie marketing start-up, Fuel & Ox.

* Kaggle's [Housing Price Predictor Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques). I enjoy Machine Learning algorithms that provide concrete business applications and offer a high degree of interpetibility.

### ðŸ“š Currently Learning More About:

* BI theory and principles. I purchased the book [Business unIntelligence](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18230651-business-unintelligence) and have been enjoying being exposed to new ideas on what goes into effective business decision making. 

* Bayesian Statistics, primarily through the book [Statistical Rethinking](https://www.routledge.com/Statistical-Rethinking-A-Bayesian-Course-with-Examples-in-R-and-STAN/McElreath/p/book/9780367139919).
